BasicallyFramework

A framework made for physics-based multiplayer games. Without needing to do the networking.
While the frameworks contains common features, the framework might need to be modified to accomodate your game's needs.

The framework handles sending data a little differently than other frameworks (Mirror, UNet)
Basically does not use RPCs in anyway, it is purely message based.
Unless you are only going to use the Entity Parameters. (Should only be used to send entity data)
